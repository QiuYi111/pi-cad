# Pi-CAD Python API

Use ordinary Python variables as working state and `import cad` as the small
engineering capability surface.

- Read `await cad.workflow.current()` before acting.
- Freeze stable handoffs with `await cad.commit(name, variables=..., artifacts=...)`.
- Load handoffs by ID with `await cad.load(id)`; do not copy child transcripts.
- Use `cad.templates` only as optional conveniences. Workflow never requires
  their schema unless a project workflow says so explicitly.
- Use `@cad.probe(subject="current")` for Agent-authored, read-only B-Rep
  calculations. Pass all values explicitly; closures and unrestricted imports
  do not cross the effect fence.
- Write task-specific engineering checks in Python. There is no `cad.verify`.
- Keep large payloads in variables/files and print only selected summaries.

Prime owns sessions, compaction, memory, and subagents. Pi-CAD commits and
artifacts are the preferred handoff objects.
